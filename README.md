# Boston Housing Price Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing a dataset on housing prices in Boston, Massachusetts, provided by the U.S. Census Service. As a data scientist for a housing agency, the goal is to generate insights for upper management to support data-driven decision-making. The project includes statistical analysis and visualization to answer specific questions posed by the management team, helping them understand various factors that may influence housing prices.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of this analysis are:
- Determine the impact of the Charles River on housing prices by examining if there's a significant difference in the median value of homes bounded by the river.
- Evaluate the influence of construction age by comparing median housing values across different proportions of homes built before 1940.
- Examine the relationship between Nitric oxide levels and the proportion of non-retail business acres per town to see if there is any correlation.
- Assess the effect of weighted distance to employment centers on the median value of homes.

## Dataset
The dataset includes various attributes such as:
- Median value of owner-occupied homes
- Proportion of owner-occupied units built before 1940
- Nitric oxide concentration levels
- Proportion of non-retail business acres per town
- Distance to employment centers, and more.

The dataset will be explored and analyzed to produce statistical insights and visualizations.

## Project Tasks
### Task 1: Dataset Familiarization
- Load and review the dataset to understand its structure, features, and any preliminary cleaning requirements.

### Task 2: Basic Statistics and Visualizations
- Generate descriptive statistics for key variables.
- Create visualizations, including histograms, scatter plots, and box plots, to visually represent the relationships between different features.

### Task 3: Statistical Analysis
- Perform appropriate statistical tests to answer the questions provided:
  - T-tests to compare median home values across categorical variables (e.g., proximity to Charles River, pre-1940 housing proportions).
  - Correlation analysis between Nitric oxide levels and non-retail business acre proportions.
  - Regression analysis to examine the relationship between distance to employment centers and median home values.

### Task 4: Notebook Submission
- Share the Jupyter Notebook containing all analysis, visualizations, and explanations for submission.

## Results Interpretation
Each statistical result will be accompanied by an interpretation, helping management understand the findings and how they can inform decision-making.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Data analysis and visualization.
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualization
  - `scipy` and `statsmodels` for statistical analysis

## Usage
1. Clone the repository and ensure you have Python and necessary libraries installed.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/uttkarsh-thakur26/Uttkarsh-s-Peer-graded-Assignment.git
   cd Uttkarsh-s-Peer-graded-Assignment

## Conclusion
- This project will provide valuable insights into housing prices in Boston, addressing upper management's questions and offering a foundation for further investigation and data-driven decisions.
